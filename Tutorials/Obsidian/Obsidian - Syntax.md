Obsidian is based on Markdown

Everything is rendered live, to view the raw code select `View` then `Source View` on your menu.
-> **Use this mode to view how I made the text here**

### Reference notes

Use square brackets like this [[Obsidian]]
### Pretty formatting

Pretty formatting using "callouts" eg:

> [!info]
> this is an info block :)

> [!warning]
> this is a warning block :o

> [!tip] Woo
> this is a block with a cool flame and custom title

### Code

Inline code like this eg `x = FastMTT()`

Block code (you can specify type for syntax highlighting)
```python
for i in range(10):
	print("hi")
```

```shell
python3 test.py
```

### Attachments

You can just paste images, but to keep things tidy, you can automatically keep them in one folder:
- Go to settings (`cmd/ctrl P` and type eg "Sett").
- Click Files and Links
- Choose a default folder for images, eg `figures`
