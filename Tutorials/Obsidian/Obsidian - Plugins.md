Plugins are useful to enhance the functionality of [[Obsidian]]

How to install (official guide [here](https://obsidian.rocks/how-to-use-community-plugins-in-obsidian/)):
- `ctrl P` (or `cmd P` on mac)
- Open Settings (eg by typing "Sett")
- Go to Community Plugins tab, turn on and browse :)
- click `Enable` after install

The ones I use are:
- `Tasks`
- `Templater`
- `Git`
- `Natural Language Dates`
- `Quick Latex`
- `Calendar`
- `DataView`
- `Clear unused images`

All plugins have their own settings you can navigate to from the menu.
