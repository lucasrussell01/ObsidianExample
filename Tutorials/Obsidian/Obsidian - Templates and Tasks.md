# Templates

Firstly, make sure you've installed the plugin `Templater` (lets you have auto date formatting etc...)

>[!warning]
>To make templater work, you need to open settings (`ctrl or cmd P` then type settings), go to templates and set your template folder to `Templates`
>

> [!info]
> Templates are activated for a note using this button on the left:  ![[Pasted image 20240814172100.png]]

-> Create a new note, then click that button, you should have the option to add the weekly setup!

> [!warning]
> You need to activate Templater after clicking the above button

This basically turns the template dates into real dates for the current week.

>[!tip]
>To do this, it can be useful to define a shortcut! 
>Open Settings, then Hotkeys, Search for `Templater: `Replace templates in the active file`

# Tasks

Tasks can be created in any note within your vault, and are centrally tracked by the `Tasks` plugin.

> [!tip]
> I recommend setting up a shortcut to create a task (eg `cmd/ctrl P`) - you can do this is Settings -> Hotkeys -> Tasks: Create or Edit Task

When you create a task you can specify a due date, urgency, and many other parameters.

To list all tasks, use this syntax:
```tasks
not done
```


You can add more filters such as `not done`, or sort by due date (which is how my weekly update template works).
