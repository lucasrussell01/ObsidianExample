Hello :) 

This is a personal (poorly written) guide to setting up Obsidian.

I've done quite a bit of playing around with setting in here to make things look nice and work efficiently.

The core is the `Vault`, essentially just a normal folder that contains all notes. More detailed guides to individual components are linked below.

Components (that I suggest going through these in order):
- [[Obsidian - Syntax]]
- [[Obsidian - Plugins]]
- [[Obsidian - Templates and Tasks]]
-> **Command (or control )click, links to open the relevant note**

I would suggest storing your vault/folder on github so you have regular backups.

There's a *very vaguely* useful guide provided by Obsidian [here](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/) if you're just getting started.
