# Obsidian Quick Start

I've put some instructions and steps to follow in this repo, to get obsidian setup faster (with some nice features I found)

### Instructions

Clone this repo locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/lucasrussell01/ObsidianExample.git
```

Download Obsidian for your system here: https://obsidian.md/

Open Obsidian, select "Open folder as vault" and open `ObsidianExample`

Navigate to `Tutorials/Obsidian/Obsidian` in the app, and give those a read :)
